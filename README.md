# FoxBot

Twitch chat mod bot using python and sockets

*note: This is a personal project for a friend and may or may not work for other twitch.tv channels.
However, I do in the future wish to make this bot usable regardless of the user of this program

## How to use for the first time

* Open cfg.py
* change CHAN to the host channel username
* change NICK to the bot username
* change PASS to your own OAuth token
* change cfg-blank.py to cfg.py
* Run bot.py then close
* Use command !addmod <name> to add all mods
* Add data to DATA list in cfg.py as needed

### Prerequisites

* Create a user on Twitch.tv that will become the bot
* Have a channel that the bot will monitor
* This code uses Python 3 so make sure it is installed on your system

### Installing

* Clone repository
* Follow instructions on How to use for first time
